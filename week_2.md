#### Maths

##### Brief forward  
  * I'm both surprised at how much I recalled from previous stats and probability
   courses as well as amazed at how many connections I hadn't made before now. 
   Maybe it's the immersion process that left me dreaming about math solutions, 
   or maybe it's just the depth at which we are working, 
   but this week has been a whirlwind. 
   I won't go into too much detail so as not to bore less-'mathy' people, 
   but it would be hard to describe this week without assuming a base-level knowledge of probability and statistics. 
   
  * For those who enjoy a nice, deep dive into the complex and fascinating 
   world of predictive and inferential stats, here are a few readings you could tackle when you feel like it:  
    1. [A visualization of Stats and Probability - Do yourself a favor and play around with this page.](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/index.html)
    2. [An introduction to hypothesis testing using SciPy as a framework - AKA how to use coding to tell the difference between two groups.](http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/11/python-for-data-analysis-part-24.html)
    3. [Bayes Statistics 101](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)  
     * written in a iPython Notebook - which is great for interactivity:)
     
     
#### Topics Covered:

1. __Probability / Stats__ 
  * Some of this is basic - things you could get a grasp on from running through a Udacity or Khan Academy course on the subject (of these two I reccommend the latter, since I found it 
  incredibly easy to grasp through his repetitive methods.) 
  * Other aspects were foreign to me. Should we use a Gamma or a Poisson Distribution? Why would Beta distributions model Bayesian inference for click-through-rate be more advantageous? 
  What size user base would you need to get the benefits of a 2% ctr increase. It got a bit hairy at times, but overall I feel VERY good at this point with my ability to learn. The teaching staff makes it easy to 
  get help when you need it and are nothing but encouraging.
  
2. __Sampling and Power__  
 ![No one man should have all that](https://media1.giphy.com/media/zm2tLgU5sqAWk/giphy.gif)
 * We took a dive into Beta, statistical power, and sample sizes. 
 It's fascinating how many different assumptions and proofs you can include in an analysis that helps cement the findings. Bootstrap day was probably my 
 favorite to date. Bootstrap is a relatively new framework for increasing your confidence in the sampling distribution you have by taking `n` random samples with replacement from your sample set. 
 It seems confusing but the pair programming made it so fun, especially when you get good enough at plotting to see new graphs and plots save in real time showing updated results with decreasing variance over time. 

That's all for now! This week was intense and I have a lot to look back at throughout the course as we build on these concepts.
