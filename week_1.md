### Week 1 of the Data Science Immersive:  
#### Programming  

##### Brief forward  
 This week was already incredibly transformative and yet a bit overwhelming at the same time. 
 By that I mean there were several moments of struggle with a few sections (ahem... plotting is not as straighforward as you'd think).
 We began the week with a two hour assessment meant to highlight our baseline coming in to the program.  
 This allows the teachers to know where to help us best and what topics need a bit more study.
 
 I personally struggled through the SQL and Calc/Linear Algebra a bit, but demolished the Python section (which, given that I'd been focusing so heavily on Python in my precourse learning, makes sense.)
 At the end of the SQL day I looked back and could easily complete the asessment questions in under ten minutes.
 I'm hoping by the end of the program, with a little help from self-study, friends in the cohort, and the lectures, I'll be able to say the same about the entire math section. 
 
 We were told these next three months would be like a firehose of information. They specifically say, 'You won't be able to pick up everything. Just try your best and make sure you're sleeping.'
 After the course I plan to revisit sections where I know I could have delved deeper, but overall, I want to spend the next few weeks acting like this:

 You get out what you put in, so crush it.

#### Topics Covered:

1. __Python (_again_)__  
 * Day one and two were a breeze for me. We had some complex individual and pair assignments, but overall I feel very confident at this point with my Python.
 On both days, my partner and I on the pair programming were able to complete all the assignment sections with plenty of time left.
  There isn't a feeling much more satisfying than being told the assignments would be challenging and then being able to complete it all in less time than the grand majority of the class.

2. __SQL__
 * SQL, after focusing on Python, feels like moving from a jackhammer to a rock. No looping. No lambda expressions. No cool interactivity. The learning curve is steep, but the way Galvanize presented on the topic made it easy to understand. 
 By the last section on the pair assignment at the end of the day, we were doing a triple self join with two temporary tables, which takes a decent amount of lines and some non-trivial skill keeping track of. It feels good to struggle and succeed.  
 Further. We learned how to export our queries to new csv's, and how to write scripts directly in a python script by using a helpful package. Without this, you have to draw out your data, save to a csv, get the filepath, import the csv into your python script, and then begin to find insights.

2. __Plotting - part 1__  
* Let me just tell you I was wrong. I thought with a background in marketing, a good grasp on graphic design, and a handle on types of math plots and when to choose each type that I would be great at plotting.  
It's more complicated than you'd think.  
Or maybe just for me. I struggled with this a lot. I conceptually understood the basics, but seemed to run into error after error after error when trying to make it run on new arrays - (looking at you, Pandas Series'...)  
This is me - with MatplotLib:

We used Matplotlib's pyplot, which is both a great tool and a bit.. well... boring. It's nice because you hypothetically could devise a script to plot in whatever you send into it, but working graphics through code is not something I was familiar with, and there's definitely a learning curve.  
Nothing a few hours on Saturday and [this helpful review](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/) couldn't help me to sort out. I'm just hoping that as the program goes on my ability to make beautiful graphs eventually reaches my expectations for myself.
